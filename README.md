# Light-out-puzzle
Light out puzzle using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm

Lights are placed in N x N grid. Each of them can be ON (1) or OFF (0). When a light is toggled, from ON to
OFF or OFF to ON, so are its horizontal and vertical neighbors â€“ if any of them exists. Find a way to switch off
all lights and print one possible sequence.
